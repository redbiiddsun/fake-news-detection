"The Trump administration has said it is freezing more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University, hours after the elite college rejected a list of demands from the White House. The White House sent a list of demands to Harvard last week which it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus. They included changes to hiring, admissions and teaching. Since Donald Trump was re-elected, his government has tried to reshape elite universities by threatening to withhold federal funds, mostly spent on research. Harvard became the first major US university to reject the administration's demands on Monday, accusing the White House of trying to control its community.",
"Trump has said he wants to see a more conservative approach to hiring and admissions at elite universities, which he claims are biased against conservatives. The White House has also called for changes to the way universities handle sexual assault cases, arguing that current policies are unfair to accused students. Harvard's rejection of the White House's demands is seen as a significant stand against the administration's efforts to reshape higher education.",
